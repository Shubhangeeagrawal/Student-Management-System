# Student-Management-System
This project is designed to simulate a simple student enrollment and tuition management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It involves creating a program where users can manage students, their enrollment in courses, and track their tuition payments. The project will require building a system that allows adding new students to a database, assigning them unique IDs, enrolling them in courses, and handling tuition payments.
- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database.
- The user should be prompted to enter a name and year for each student.
- The student should have a unique 5-digit id, with the first being their grade level.
- The student should have several course options to choose from.
- Each course costs $600 to enroll.
- The student should be able to check their balance and pay tuition.
- The status of the student should show their name, id, courses, and balance.
